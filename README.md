##Try it out!
###Run from source code
Boats Animator has been created using web technologies, however it has been designed to work as a native application using [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js). Information on how to run Boats Animator straight from its source code can be found on the [NW.js wiki](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-run-apps).

###Downloadable executable
Boats Animator is pre-release software and currently lacks a number of key features needed to make stop motion animations, however you can check out what has been implemented so far in the [releases section](https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/animator/releases). This will be periodically updated with alpha and beta builds of Boats Animator as we work towards its first full release.
